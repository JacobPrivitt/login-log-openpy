# login-log-openpy

Little side project I have been working on. It has C++ I/O for login in and logging out.
Then I added a hash function to protect the user credentials and save them to a file.
Then once you have logged in, it logs the time that you entered the software and grants access to the program.
Then finally the program opens python in your terminal. Because you should use python.

I am using this software to practice penatration testing on VM's by breaking into a host, finding this software, cracking the hash, 
and getting you use the amazing language that is python. 

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.
